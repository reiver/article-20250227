# Can Bluesky & the Fediverse Censor

Recently Bluesky made the news again — this time, Bluesky was accused of censoring political speech.

And once again people wondered — how is it possible that Bluesky, which claims to be a decentralized social-media network (and thus not having the problems that centralized social-media does), is able to censor or moderate anyone or anything off of the whole network?
And, is a social-media network that can in practice do this actually decentralized?

Although, in many ways, Bluesky has been stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ when it comes to moderation — they are _damned when you do and damned when you don't_.

So, what happened‽

## What Was Censored

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky deleted a viral, AI-generated protest video in which Donald Trump is sucking on Elon Musk’s toes […].
> The video was broadcast on televisions inside the office Housing and Urban Development earlier this week, and quickly went viral on Bluesky and Twitter.
>
> [Independent journalist](https://www.thehandbasket.co/) [Marisa Kabas](https://marisakabas.bsky.social/) obtained a video from a government employee and posted it on Bluesky, where it went viral. Tuesday night, Bluesky moderators deleted the video […].

## Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place

In some ways, Bluesky is stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ — they are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ — they are _between the devil and the deep blue sea _.

Bluesky will be blamed if they do take action and and will be blamed if the don't take action.

## Political Bias

## Moderation, Censorship

What is the difference between **moderation** and **censorship**‽

I any people's minds, these words ha

It is true that, in practice, "Moderation" and "Censorship" have the same meaning

(It is just that the connotation is different  — one is usually seen as positive where the other is usually seen as negative)

The problem is not that there is Moderation / Censorship per se —

The problem is WHO is in control of it —

You? Or someone else?

Do YOU get to decide what YOU do and do not get exposed to?

Or does someone else get to decide, against your will

## Why Decentralization Matters

Why does decentralization matter‽

Decentralization is a means to an end
—
it produces a desired outcome.
It lets you escape something you feel is _bad_.

The world is _less-worse_ and even a _better_ place when people, in general, can escape what they feel are _bad_ situation_.
And, even better, if they can escape it without being ruined in the process.

The decentralization of social-media lets you escape _bad_ situation on social-media.

... examples ...

A single server on any decentralized social-media (DeSo) network, whether Bluesky, the Fediverse, or anything else — is vulnerable to manipulation, censorship, spying, and control — whether corporate, gov't, political, or any other type — just like centralized social-media.

A single server on the Fediverse is also vulnerable to capture & takeover — just like centralized social-media.

But (unlike centralized social-media) here is the good thing about decentralized social-media (DeSo) —

A user on the Fediverse has a way of escaping — to someone else's server or their own server — if they feel things have gotten _bad_ on the server they are on.

And, they can take their followers and who they follow with them, etc, to the new account.

And (eventually) they can take their content with them, too.

And (if they are making their income on social-media) can take their livelihood with them, too, when they escape.

That is part of the value of decentralization.

You have a way of escaping — and a way of taking everything important with you.

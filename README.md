# Can Bluesky & the Fediverse Censor

Recently Bluesky made the news again — this time, Bluesky was accused of censoring political speech.

And once again people wondered — how is it possible that Bluesky, which claims to be a decentralized social-media network (and thus not having the problems that centralized social-media does), is able to censor or moderate anyone or anything off of the whole network?
And, is a social-media network that can in practice do this actually decentralized?

Although, in many ways, Bluesky has been stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ when it comes to moderation — they are _damned when you do and damned when you don't_

## What Was Censored

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky deleted a viral, AI-generated protest video in which Donald Trump is sucking on Elon Musk’s toes […].
> The video was broadcast on televisions inside the office Housing and Urban Development earlier this week, and quickly went viral on Bluesky and Twitter.
>
> [Independent journalist](https://www.thehandbasket.co/) [Marisa Kabas](https://marisakabas.bsky.social/) obtained a video from a government employee and posted it on Bluesky, where it went viral. Tuesday night, Bluesky moderators deleted the video […].

## Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place

In some ways, Bluesky is stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ — they are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ — they are _between the devil and the deep blue sea _.

Bluesky will be blamed if they do take action and and will be blamed if the don't take action.

## Political Bias

## Moderation, Censorship

What is the difference between **moderation** and **censorship**‽

I any people's minds, these words ha

It is true that, in practice, "Moderation" and "Censorship" have the same meaning

(It is just that the connotation is different  — one is usually seen as positive where the other is usually seen as negative)

The problem is not that there is Moderation / Censorship per se —

The problem is WHO is in control of it —

You? Or someone else?

Do YOU get to decide what YOU do and do not get exposed to?

Or does someone else get to decide, against your will

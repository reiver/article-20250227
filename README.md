# Can Bluesky & the Fediverse Censor

Recently Bluesky made the news again — this time, Bluesky was accused of censoring political speech.

And once again people wondered — how is it possible that Bluesky, who claims to be a decentralized social-media network (and thus not having the problems that centralized social-media does), is able to censor anyone? Is a social-media network that can in practice censor anything or anyone across the whole network actually decentralized?

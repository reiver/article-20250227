# Can Bluesky & the Fediverse Censor

Recently Bluesky made the news again — this time, Bluesky was accused of censoring political speech.
And in particular, political speech focused as President Trump and Elon Musk.

And, once again some people wondered — how is it possible that Bluesky, a decentralized social-media network, is able to censor or moderate anyone or anything off of the whole network?
Shouldn't decentralization make this form of censorship impossible?

In many ways, Bluesky has been stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ when it comes to moderation
—
they have been publicly criticized both when they have take a _hands-off_ approach to moderation, and they take a _hands-on_ approach to moderation.
I.e., they are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_.

So, what happened‽
And, why does this matter‽

## What Was Censored

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky deleted a viral, AI-generated protest video in which Donald Trump is sucking on Elon Musk’s toes […].
> The video was broadcast on televisions inside the office Housing and Urban Development earlier this week, and quickly went viral on Bluesky and Twitter.
>
> [Independent journalist](https://www.thehandbasket.co/) [Marisa Kabas](https://marisakabas.bsky.social/) obtained a video from a government employee and posted it on Bluesky, where it went viral. Tuesday night, Bluesky moderators deleted the video […].
>
> […]
>
> [Other Bluesky users](https://bsky.app/profile/gxldsociety.bsky.social/post/3liyevyytjs2s) said that [versions of the video they uploaded](https://bsky.app/profile/justnothavingit.bsky.social/post/3liymxxqts22h) were also deleted […].

[Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) later prepended the article to say:

> Bluesky restored Kabas' post and told 404 Media the following: "This was a case of our moderators applying the policy for non-consensual AI content strictly. After re-evaluating the newsworthy context, the moderation team is reinstating those posts."

## Who

Donald John Trump is the (at the time of writing of this article) the 47th president of the United States of America.

President Trump 
the 45th and now (at the time of writing of this article) the 47th president of the United States of America, former host of the _reality_ TV show _The Apprentice_, and traditionally, prior to becoming president of the United States, also widely thought of an exemplar of a rich, successful person.

## Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place

In some ways, Bluesky is stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ — they are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ — they are _between the devil and the deep blue sea _.

Bluesky will be blamed if they do take action and and will be blamed if the don't take action.

## Political Bias

## Moderation, Censorship

What is the difference between **moderation** and **censorship**‽

I any people's minds, these words ha

It is true that, in practice, "Moderation" and "Censorship" have the same meaning

(It is just that the connotation is different  — one is usually seen as positive where the other is usually seen as negative)

The problem is not that there is Moderation / Censorship per se —

The problem is WHO is in control of it —

You? Or someone else?

Do YOU get to decide what YOU do and do not get exposed to?

Or does someone else get to decide, against your will

## Why Decentralization Matters

Why does decentralization matter‽

Decentralization is a means to an end
—
it produces a desired outcome.
It lets you escape something you feel is _bad_.

The world is _less-worse_ and even a _better_ place when people, in general, can escape what they feel are _bad_ situation_.
And, even better, if they can escape it without being ruined in the process.

The decentralization of social-media lets you escape _bad_ situation on social-media.

... examples ...

A single server on any decentralized social-media (DeSo) network, whether Bluesky, the Fediverse, or anything else — is vulnerable to manipulation, censorship, spying, and control — whether corporate, gov't, political, or any other type — just like centralized social-media.

A single server on the Fediverse is also vulnerable to capture & takeover — just like centralized social-media.

But (unlike centralized social-media) here is the good thing about decentralized social-media (DeSo) —

A user on the Fediverse has a way of escaping — to someone else's server or their own server — if they feel things have gotten _bad_ on the server they are on.

And, they can take their followers and who they follow with them, etc, to the new account.

And (eventually) they can take their content with them, too.

And (if they are making their income on social-media) can take their livelihood with them, too, when they escape.

That is part of the value of decentralization.

You have a way of escaping — and a way of taking everything important with you.

## Decentralization Has Helped

## Truth Social

It is perhaps interesting that one of the best examples of a politician using an independent social-media platform — and one based on decentralized social-media (DeSo) technologies — is: President Donland J. Trump on Truth Social.

President Trump has had a Twitter account since March 2009, and had been active on Twitter long before he became the 45th (and 47th) president of the United Statues of America (POTUS).

Starting in the year 2015, Mr. Trump's Twitter presence took on another significance — as he _ran for_ and _became_ the 45th POTUS.
And, he and his Twitter account became the target of both _jeers_ and _cheers_ — as is not uncommon for many individuals who take on a political-life or political-office.

[In January 2021, President Trump's Twitter account was suspended.](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension)
This was a significant event.
President Trump's Twitter account was a means by which he communicated in a more-or-less direct and unfiltered manner with hundreds-of-millions of people — perhaps more.
To both his fans & supporters, as well as his critics & skeptics.
When President Trump's Twitter account was suspended, that medium, that ability, disappeared for him.

A little more than one year later, on February 2022, Mr. Trump appeared online again.
This time Mr. Trump appeared on a new social-media network named _Truth Social_.

Truth Social is a Twitter-like social-media network — i.e., a micro-blogging social-media network.

Truth Social runs on a modified version of the Mastodon software.
And, although Truth Social is currently **not** part of the Fediverse — this is the same Mastodon software that powers a large portion of the Fediverse.

Mastodon (like much of the software that powers the Fediverse) is free and open-source software (FOSS) — and _anyone_ can use it.
Including Truth Social.

And, just like the many minorities, political dissidents, activists, and others that used Mastdon as a way of escaping a _bad_ situation — so too did Mr. Trump.

## Mastodon Users

Mastodon is the same software that has been used to create a safe home for many minorities, for political dissidents, for activists, and more.
And, Mastodon is also the software that powers Truth Social.

Some argue that we should _cherry-pick_ who may and may not use software such as Mastodon.

Others (including some critics & skeptics of President Trump) will argue that — the power to cherry-pick like that will create a much, much worse situation.
That the power to cherry-pick would also give people the power to discrimate against minorities, for political dissidents, for activists, and more.
And, that is worse.

> The cure is worse than the "disease".

Perhaps that phrase the general sentiment.

Others (including some critics & skeptics of President Trump) will argue that this is a good thing.
That the alternative is worse.

That with an alternative to this, that would ##### the _the cure would be worse than the "disease"_.

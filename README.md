# Is Bluesky Falling Into Twitter’s Trap? The Censorship Controversy

Bluesky's handling of political speech and claim of decentralization is under fire — is it really living up to the hopes and the hype‽
Recently accused of censoring political speech targeting President Trump and Elon Musk, Bluesky is facing tough questions about its true nature, its authenticity, and its approach.
Is Bluesky simply Twitter 2.0 in disguise, or is it caught in a moderation nightmare?
Let’s dive in and uncover the truth behind the controversy.

## Moderation or Censorship

Bluesky is back in the headlines — but this time, it is facing accusations of censoring political speech.
The controversy centers around a viral AI-generated protest video targeting President Trump and Elon Musk, which was removed by the Bluesky team from the Bluesky platform.

The protest video was likely a response to activities engaged in by the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative promoted by both President Trump and Elon Musk.

But there is big question:
how can Bluesky, a decentralized platform, censor content at all?
How can they remove content from the entire Bluesky network?
Shouldn’t decentralization make such censorship impossible?
Is Bluesky actually decentralized?
Is Bluesky really living up to its promises of decentralization, or is it just another version of Twitter — equally prone to manipulation, censorship, and control?

In many ways, Bluesky has been stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ when it comes to moderation.
Bluesky’s moderation struggles over the years have sparked criticism from many sides.
They have been criticized for both overreach and inaction, finding themselves stuck in a constant catch-22.
They have been publicly critcized both when they have chosen to take a _hands-off_ approach to moderation, _and_ when they have chosen to taken a _hands-on_ approach to moderation.
They are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ — and can’t seem to escape backlash.

## What Was Censored

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky deleted a viral, AI-generated protest video in which Donald Trump is sucking on Elon Musk’s toes […].
> The video was broadcast on televisions inside the office Housing and Urban Development earlier this week, and quickly went viral on Bluesky and Twitter.
>
> [Independent journalist](https://www.thehandbasket.co/) [Marisa Kabas](https://marisakabas.bsky.social/) obtained a video from a government employee and posted it on Bluesky, where it went viral. Tuesday night, Bluesky moderators deleted the video […].

> [Other Bluesky users](https://bsky.app/profile/gxldsociety.bsky.social/post/3liyevyytjs2s) said that [versions of the video they uploaded](https://bsky.app/profile/justnothavingit.bsky.social/post/3liymxxqts22h) were also deleted […].

[Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) later prepended the article to say:

> Bluesky restored Kabas' post and told 404 Media the following: "This was a case of our moderators applying the policy for non-consensual AI content strictly. After re-evaluating the newsworthy context, the moderation team is reinstating those posts."

[The full video can be seen on Marisa Kabas' Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3liwlwvvq6k2s) again, since it was restored.

## What Was Being Protested

This AI-generated protest video is causing a fuss — but what is it really about‽

Watching the video, it is clear that it focuses on at least two major figures — President Trump, and Elon Musk.

However, there is likely a third major element in the mix.
A subtext that motivates the protest — the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
In particular, what the DOGE is believed to have been doing on behalf of both President Trump, and Elon Musk.

This is speculation, but
—
the protest video may also be attempting to create division between President Trump and Elon Musk
—
possibly using a political strategy reminiscent of the wedge that was driven between President Trump and Steve Bannon during President Trump's first term.
Perhaps this be an effort to slow down, or even stop, the DOGE by remomving Mr. Musk from the picture.

Let's unpack this further.

## Donald John Trump

From real-estate mogul to reality TV star to President of the United States (POTUS), Donald John Trump’s rise to POTUS is unconventional.

Donald J. Trump is 47th president of the United States of America.
And, at the time of writing, the sitting POTUS.

President Trump is also the 45th POTUS, was the former host of the _reality_ TV show _The Apprentice_, is a well-known businessman, and traditionally has been widely thought of as an exemplar of a rich & successful person, and a symbol for status, wealth, and power among many.

Although, since his presidency, President Trump has gained a large number of opponents, critics, and detractors who berate, condemn, and malign him.
As well as, blame him for division in the U.S. and many political ills.
There is an ongoing debate as to whether President Trump's rise to POTUS caused the division & political ills or is a result of pre-existing division & political ills.
I.e., what (if any) is the direction causation?

Perhaps unknown or forgotten by many, before his presidency, President Trump also made cameos in the movies
"The Little Rascals" (1994),
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992), 
"Zoolander" (2001),
and
"Two Weeks Notice" (2002).
And, also made appearances in various TV shows, including:
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air",
and
"The Nanny".
Mr. Trump was famous _long before_ he became POTUS.

on January 20th, 2025, President Trump officially created the DOGE by [executive order 14158](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02005/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency).

## Elon Reeve Musk

No president of the United States of America goes at it alone.
President Trump, like presidents before him, has a team behind him — which includes his cabinet and his advisors.

One of President Trump's senior advsiors, allies, and public supporters is Elon Reeve Musk.

Elon Musk is a businessman, known for his roles in
—
the electric car company _Tesla_,
the space tehnology company _SpaceX_,
the satellite Internet company _Starlink_,
and acquiring _Twitter_ (and rebranding it to "𝕏").
Mr. Musk is also a member of the (so called) "_PayPal Mafia_"
—
a group of former PayPal employees and founders who (after PayPal) went on to found, create, or develop additional technology companies, often based in Silicon Valley.
In addition to this, Mr. Musk is also known for advocating the establishment of a permanent human presence on the planet Mars.

Like President Trump, Mr Musk has also gained a large number of opponents, critics, and detractors.
This seemed to have largely started when Mr. Musk became publicly critical of policy and politics associated with the U.S. Democratic Party, as well as expressing that he would vote for Republican Party candidates due to his dissatisfaction with incumbent U.S. Democratic Party members.

Mr. Musk is sometimes compared to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)'s _Tony Stark_ character
—
as a real-life _Iron Man_.
Although, Mr. Musk's opponents, critics, and detractors would likely characterize Mr. Musk as another of MCU _Tony Stark_'s alter-egos — the MCU villain Doctor Doom.
Mr. Musk now has both fan and foe.

Related to the AI-generated protest video
—
not only has Elon Musk has been a public advocate for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but
—
Elon Musk is publicly understood to be the _de facto_ head of the DOGE.

So, perhaps the protestors' political strategy is to, _take out the leader_ to slowdown or stop the DOGE, and make it ineffectual.

## Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)

But why all the concern about the DOGE‽

Promoted by Elon Musk, Mr. Musk has described the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a transformative initiative aimed at streamlining government operations and reducing wasteful spending.
He envisions DOGE as a "meritocratic federal government that rewards excellence," focusing on promoting high-performing government workers and implementing significant cost-saving measures.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — whose name is a play on the **Doge meme** — is an initiative by President Trump's second administration.
The DOGE was officially created by President Trump on January 20th, 2025 by [executive order 14158](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02005/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency).

...

## “Long Live The Real King”

The AI-generated video is overlayed with the text:

> Long Live The Real King

This is likely meant to be a message for President Trump.
This is likely meant to evoke a response from President Trump.

Perhaps meant to enrage President Trump — by suggesting that he is subordinate to Mr. Musk, rather than the other way around.
In the hopes that an engaged Trump will remove Elon Musk as the _de facto_ head of the DOGE.
Thus ??? the DOGE.

## Steve Bannon

But, have we seen this strategy before‽

During President Trump's first term, a cartoon appeared suggesting simlilar — suggesting that President Trump was subordinate another member of his team.
In particular, that time suggesting President Trump was subordinate to his former chief strategist — Stephen Kevin Bannon.

Steve Bannon is ....

After the cartoon surfaces, after seven months of serving as chief strategist in President Trump's first term, Mr. Bannon was discharged from his position.
Mr. Bannon was no longer part of President Trump's team.

That time the cartoon may have worked — Mr. Bannon was gone.
But, will the AI-generated protest video have the same effect with respect to Mr. Musk — will Mr. Musk be gone, too?

## Why Was It Censored

Why was the AI-generated protest video censorshed from the Bluesky platform‽

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

...

In the U.S., the first amdendment is often considered sacrosanct.

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Included in this text is the concept of _freedom of speech_.
In particular, the point of view of law — and ....

But in the U.S, _freedom of speech_ as social-form (that goes beyond the requirements of the law) is common, too.
...

## Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place

So what does this mean for Bluesky‽

In some ways, Bluesky is stuck _betweeen a rock and a hard place_ — they are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ — they are _between the devil and the deep blue sea _.

Bluesky will be blamed if they do take action and and will be blamed if the don't take action.

## Political Bias

## Moderation, Censorship

What is the difference between **moderation** and **censorship**‽

I any people's minds, these words ha

It is true that, in practice, "Moderation" and "Censorship" have the same meaning

(It is just that the connotation is different  — one is usually seen as positive where the other is usually seen as negative)

The problem is not that there is Moderation / Censorship per se —

The problem is WHO is in control of it —

You? Or someone else?

Do YOU get to decide what YOU do and do not get exposed to?

Or does someone else get to decide, against your will

## Why Decentralization Matters

Why does decentralization matter‽

Decentralization is a means to an end
—
it produces a desired outcome.
It lets you escape something you feel is _bad_.

The world is _less-worse_ and even a _better_ place when people, in general, can escape what they feel are _bad_ situation_.
And, even better, if they can escape it without being ruined in the process.

The decentralization of social-media lets you escape _bad_ situation on social-media.

... examples ...

A single server on any decentralized social-media (DeSo) network, whether Bluesky, the Fediverse, or anything else — is vulnerable to manipulation, censorship, spying, and control — whether corporate, gov't, political, or any other type — just like centralized social-media.

A single server on the Fediverse is also vulnerable to capture & takeover — just like centralized social-media.

But (unlike centralized social-media) here is the good thing about decentralized social-media (DeSo) —

A user on the Fediverse has a way of escaping — to someone else's server or their own server — if they feel things have gotten _bad_ on the server they are on.

And, they can take their followers and who they follow with them, etc, to the new account.

And, (eventually) they can take their content with them, too.

And, (if they are making their income on social-media) can take their livelihood with them, too, when they escape.

That is part of the value of decentralization.

You have a way of escaping — and a way of taking everything important with you.

## Decentralization Has Helped

## Truth Social

It is perhaps interesting that one of the best examples of a politician using an independent social-media platform — and one based on decentralized social-media (DeSo) technologies — is: President Donland J. Trump on Truth Social.

President Trump has had a Twitter account since March 2009, and had been active on Twitter long before he became the 45th (and 47th) president of the United Statues of America (POTUS).

Starting in the year 2015, Mr. Trump's Twitter presence took on another significance — as he _ran for_ and _became_ the 45th POTUS.
And, he and his Twitter account became the target of both _jeers_ and _cheers_ — as is not uncommon for many individuals who take on a political-life or political-office.

[In January 2021, President Trump's Twitter account was suspended.](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension)
This was a significant event.
President Trump's Twitter account was a means by which he communicated in a more-or-less direct and unfiltered manner with hundreds-of-millions of people — perhaps more.
To both his fans & supporters, as well as his critics & skeptics.
When President Trump's Twitter account was suspended, that medium, that ability, disappeared for him.

A little more than one year later, on February 2022, Mr. Trump appeared online again.
This time Mr. Trump appeared on a new social-media network named _Truth Social_.

Truth Social is a Twitter-like social-media network — i.e., a micro-blogging social-media network.

Truth Social runs on a modified version of the Mastodon software.
And, although Truth Social is currently **not** part of the Fediverse — this is the same Mastodon software that powers a large portion of the Fediverse.

Mastodon (like much of the software that powers the Fediverse) is free and open-source software (FOSS) — and _anyone_ can use it.
Including Truth Social.

And, just like the many minorities, political dissidents, activists, and others that used Mastdon as a way of escaping a _bad_ situation — so too did Mr. Trump.

## Mastodon Users

Mastodon is the same software that has been used to create a safe home for many minorities, for political dissidents, for activists, and more.
And, Mastodon is also the software that powers Truth Social.

Some argue that we should _cherry-pick_ who may and may not use software such as Mastodon.

Others (including some critics & skeptics of President Trump) will argue that — the power to cherry-pick like that will create a much, much worse situation.
That the power to cherry-pick would also give people the power to discrimate against minorities, for political dissidents, for activists, and more.
And, that is worse.

> The cure is worse than the "disease".

Perhaps that phrase the general sentiment.

Others (including some critics & skeptics of President Trump) will argue that this is a good thing.
That the alternative is worse.

That with an alternative to this, that would ##### the _the cure would be worse than the "disease"_.

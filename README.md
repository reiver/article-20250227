# Is Bluesky Falling Into Twitter‚Äôs Trap? The Censorship Controversy

Bluesky's handling of political speech and claim of decentralization is under fire ‚Äî is it really living up to the hopes and the hype‚ÄΩ
Recently accused of censoring political speech targeting President Trump and Elon Musk, Bluesky is facing tough questions about its true nature, its authenticity, and its approach.
Is Bluesky simply Twitter 2.0 in disguise, or is it caught in a moderation nightmare?
Let‚Äôs dive in and uncover the truth behind the controversy.

## What Is Bluesky

Bluesky is not just another social-media network ‚Äî it is one that shares deep roots with Twitter, and promises to solve many of the problems Twitter has had.
Originally a project within Twitter, Bluesky has separated from Twitter and grown into its own separate platform.

Part of Bluesky's strategy for being _better than Twitter_ is ‚Äî decentralization.

In fact, Bluesky is _not_ alone in championing _decentralization_.
Bluesky is one of a number of decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks ‚Äî which includes the Fediverse (which both Mastodon and Meta's Threads are a part of), Nostr, and Farcaster.

Both Bluesky and the Fediverse (including both Mastodon & Threads) have attracted significant media coverage in recent years.
And, it is again that Bluesky is in the news.

## Moderation or Censorship

Bluesky is back in the headlines ‚Äî but this time, it is facing accusations of censoring political speech.
The controversy centers around a viral AI-generated protest video targeting President Trump and Elon Musk, which was removed by the Bluesky team from the Bluesky platform.

The protest video was likely a response to activities engaged in by the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative promoted by both President Trump and Elon Musk.

But there is big question:
how can Bluesky, a decentralized platform, censor content at all?
How was it possible for them to remove content from the entire Bluesky network?
Shouldn‚Äôt decentralization make such censorship impossible?
Is Bluesky actually decentralized?
Is Bluesky really living up to its promises of decentralization, or is it just another version of Twitter ‚Äî equally prone to manipulation, censorship, and control?

In many ways, Bluesky has been stuck _between a rock and a hard place_ when it comes to moderation.
Bluesky‚Äôs moderation struggles over the years have sparked criticism from many sides.
They have been criticized for both overreach and inaction, finding themselves stuck in a constant catch-22.
They have been publicly critcized both when they have chosen to take a _hands-off_ approach to moderation, _and_ when they have chosen to taken a _hands-on_ approach to moderation.
They are _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ ‚Äî and can‚Äôt seem to escape backlash.

## What Was Censored

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky deleted a viral, AI-generated protest video in which Donald Trump is sucking on Elon Musk‚Äôs toes [‚Ä¶].
> The video was broadcast on televisions inside the office Housing and Urban Development earlier this week, and quickly went viral on Bluesky and Twitter.
>
> [Independent journalist](https://www.thehandbasket.co/) [Marisa Kabas](https://marisakabas.bsky.social/) obtained a video from a government employee and posted it on Bluesky, where it went viral. Tuesday night, Bluesky moderators deleted the video [‚Ä¶].
>
> [‚Ä¶]
>
> [Other Bluesky users](https://bsky.app/profile/gxldsociety.bsky.social/post/3liyevyytjs2s) said that [versions of the video they uploaded](https://bsky.app/profile/justnothavingit.bsky.social/post/3liymxxqts22h) were also deleted [‚Ä¶].

[The full video can be seen on Marisa Kabas' Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3liwlwvvq6k2s) again, since it was later restored.

## What Was Being Protested

This AI-generated protest video is causing a fuss ‚Äî but what is it really about‚ÄΩ

Watching the video, it is clear that it focuses on at least two major figures ‚Äî President Trump, and Elon Musk.

However, there is likely a third major element in the mix.
A subtext that motivates the protest ‚Äî the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
In particular, what the DOGE is believed to have been doing on behalf of both President Trump, and Elon Musk.

This is speculation, but
‚Äî
the protest video may also be attempting to create division between President Trump and Elon Musk
‚Äî
possibly using a political strategy reminiscent of the wedge that was driven between President Trump and Steve Bannon during President Trump's first term.
The goal?
Perhaps to slow down ‚Äî or even halt ‚Äî the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by removing Musk from the picture.

Let's unpack this further.

## Donald John Trump

From real-estate mogul to reality TV star to President of the United States (POTUS), Donald John Trump‚Äôs rise to POTUS is unconventional.

Donald J. Trump is 47th president of the United States of America.
And, at the time of writing, the sitting POTUS.

President Trump is also the 45th POTUS, was the former host of the _reality_ TV show _The Apprentice_, is a well-known businessman, and traditionally has been widely thought of as an exemplar of a rich & successful person, and a symbol for status, wealth, and power among many.

Although, since his presidency, President Trump has gained a large number of opponents, critics, and detractors who berate, condemn, and malign him.
As well as, blame him for division in the U.S. and many political ills.
There is an ongoing debate as to whether President Trump's rise to POTUS caused the division & political ills or is a result of pre-existing division & political ills.
I.e., what (if any) is the direction causation?

Perhaps unknown or forgotten by many, before his presidency President Trump also made cameos in a number movies
‚Äî
including:
"The Little Rascals" (1994),
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992), 
"Zoolander" (2001),
and
"Two Weeks Notice" (2002).
Also, he made appearances in various TV shows, including:
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air",
and
"The Nanny".
Mr. Trump was famous _long before_ he became POTUS.

Related to the AI-generated protest video
‚Äî
on January 20th, 2025, President Trump officially created the DOGE by [executive order 14158](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02005/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency).

## Elon Reeve Musk

No president of the United States of America goes at it alone.
President Trump, like presidents before him, has a team behind him ‚Äî which includes his cabinet and his advisors.

One of President Trump's senior advsiors, allies, and public supporters is Elon Reeve Musk.

Elon Musk is a businessman, known for his roles in
‚Äî
the electric car company _Tesla_,
the space tehnology company _SpaceX_,
the satellite Internet company _Starlink_,
and acquiring _Twitter_ (and rebranding it to "ùïè").
Mr. Musk is also a member of the (so called) "_PayPal Mafia_"
‚Äî
a group of former PayPal employees and founders who (after PayPal) went on to found, create, or develop additional technology companies, often based in Silicon Valley.
In addition to this, Mr. Musk is also known for advocating the establishment of a permanent human presence on the planet Mars.

Like President Trump, Mr Musk has also gained a large number of opponents, critics, and detractors.
This seemed to have largely started when Mr. Musk became publicly critical of policy and politics associated with the U.S. Democratic Party, as well as expressing that he would vote for Republican Party candidates due to his dissatisfaction with incumbent U.S. Democratic Party members.

Mr. Musk is sometimes compared to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)'s _Tony Stark_ character
‚Äî
as a real-life _Iron Man_.
Although, Mr. Musk's opponents, critics, and detractors would likely characterize Mr. Musk as another of MCU _Tony Stark_'s alter-egos ‚Äî the MCU villain Doctor Doom.
Mr. Musk now has both fan and foe.

Related to the AI-generated protest video
‚Äî
not only has Elon Musk has been a public advocate for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but
‚Äî
Elon Musk is publicly understood to be the _de facto_ head of the DOGE.

So, perhaps the protestors' political strategy is to, _take out the deputy_ to slowdown or stop the DOGE, and make it ineffectual.

## Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)

But why all the concern about the DOGE‚ÄΩ

Promoted by Elon Musk, Mr. Musk has described the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a transformative initiative aimed at streamlining government operations and reducing wasteful spending.
He envisions DOGE as a "meritocratic federal government that rewards excellence," focusing on promoting high-performing government workers and implementing significant cost-saving measures.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) ‚Äî whose name is a play on the **Doge meme** ‚Äî is an initiative by President Trump's second administration.
The DOGE was officially created by President Trump on January 20th, 2025 by [executive order 14158](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02005/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency).

The DOGE has faced criticism and concern.
These included:

* **mass layoffs** ‚Äî ...
* **safety** ‚Äî ...
* **concerns over overreach** ‚Äî ...
* **conflict of interest** ‚Äî ...
* **growth matters more** ‚Äî ...

With all this concern and criticism, _why_ is the DOGE doing what it is doing?

* **ability to govern** / **control** ‚Äî ...
* **reducing government spending** ‚Äî ...
* **removing influence associated with Democratic Party** ‚Äî ...

...

## ‚ÄúLong Live The Real King‚Äù

The AI-generated video is overlayed with the text:

> Long Live The Real King

This is likely meant to be a message for President Trump.
And, likely meant to evoke a response from President Trump.

Perhaps meant to enrage President Trump ‚Äî by suggesting that he is subordinate to Mr. Musk, rather than the other way around.
In the hopes that an engaged Trump will remove Elon Musk as the _de facto_ head of the DOGE.
Thus making the DOGE ineffectual.

## Steve Bannon

But, have we seen this strategy before‚ÄΩ

During President Trump's first term, a cartoon appeared suggesting simlilar ‚Äî suggesting that President Trump was subordinate another member of his team.
In particular, that time suggesting President Trump was subordinate to his former chief strategist ‚Äî Stephen Kevin Bannon.

Steve Bannon is ....

After the cartoon surfaced, after seven months of serving as chief strategist in President Trump's first term, Mr. Bannon was discharged from his position by President Trump.
Mr. Bannon was no longer part of President Trump's team.

That time the cartoon may have worked ‚Äî Mr. Bannon was gone.
But, will the AI-generated protest video have the same effect with respect to Mr. Musk ‚Äî will Mr. Musk be gone, too?

## Why Was It Censored And Then Uncensored

Why was the AI-generated protest video censorshed from the Bluesky platform‚ÄΩ
And, why was it later uncensored‚ÄΩ

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky deleted a viral, AI-generated protest video in which Donald Trump is sucking on Elon Musk‚Äôs toes because its moderators said it was ‚Äúnon-consensual explicit material.‚Äù

Section 2.E. of [Bluesky's Community Guidelines](https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines) does indeed seem to speak on this:

> 2. Treat others with respect. For example, no:
>  
> A. Harassment or abuse directed at a specific person or group, including but not limited to, sexual harassment and gender identity-based harassment
> 
> B. Promoting hate or extremist conduct that targets people or groups based on their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation
> 
> C. Threats of violence or physical harm, or content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies violence against people, groups, or animals
> 
> D. Encouraging self-harm or suicide
> 
> <mark>E. Depictions of excessive violence, gore, torture, dismemberment, or non-consensual sexual activity</mark>
> 
> F. Misleading impersonation of other individuals, organizations, or entities

The Bluesky moderator did seem to be following Bluesky's Community Guidelines when he or she censored AI-generated protest video ‚Äî and yet, it was later uncensored and restored.

So, why was it later uncensored‚ÄΩ

According to [Jason Koebler](https://mastodon.social/@jasonkoebler) who later prepended the [404 Media article](https://www.404media.co/bluesky-deletes-ai-protest-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-calls-it-non-consensual-explicit-material/):

> Bluesky restored Kabas' post and told 404 Media the following: "This was a case of our moderators applying the policy for non-consensual AI content strictly. After re-evaluating the newsworthy context, the moderation team is reinstating those posts."

This undoing of the censorship was likely a reaction to the backlash the Bluesky team received after censoring the protest video.
We can only speculate, but I suspect that ‚Äî if there was no backlash, then the protest video would likely still be censored on the Bluesky platform.

## Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place

In some ways, Bluesky is stuck _between a rock and a hard place_ ‚Äî do they moderate or do they _not_ moderate‚ÄΩ
They seem to be _damned if you do and damned if you don't_ ‚Äî and stuck _between the devil and the deep blue sea_.

Bluesky initially took a hands-off approach to moderation.
A policy that was _cheered_ by many, later attracted _jeers_.

In July 2023, [Bluesky attracted jeers and controversy](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/bluesky-racism-slur-apology-feedback/) when Bluesky was criticized for not preventing racist content.

As a reaction to this, Bluesky decided to take a hands-on apporach and moderate
‚Äî
they created the [Bluesky community guidelines](https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines) and hired moderators.

Fans of the prior hands-off approach may see this change as heavy-handed, a violation of social-norms around freedom of speech, and a _cure that is worse than the disease_.

However, this is constrasted by fans of the hands-on approach, who may see it as, a reasonable attempt by Bluesky to protect its users through the use of moderation.

And yet, this _reasonable attempt by Bluesky to protect is users through moderation_ resulted in a backlash and new controversy. 

It feels as if Bluesky will be blamed if they _do_ take action and and will (also) be blamed if the _don't_ take action.

## Protests and Freedom of Speech

Maybe part of this conflict can be better understood through what tends to get called _freedom of speech_.

In the U.S., the first amdendment is often considered sacrosanct.

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Included in this text is the concept of _freedom of speech_.
In particular, _freedom of speech_ as law ‚Äî a particular set of restrictions on what the U.S. government is permitted to do.

But, Bluesky is not the U.S. government.
This form of _freedom of speech_ would _not_ apply to them.

However, in the U.S., _freedom of speech_ as social-norm (that goes beyond the requirements of the law) is common, too.
The idea that ....
And, perhaps captured by the children's rhyme:

> Sticks and stones may break my bones,  
> but words [such as _abusive language_ and _insults_] shall never hurt me. 

Should there be _freedom of speech_ (as a social-norm) on Bluesky or not?

Some say "yes".
Some say "no".

Protests are often protected due to both _freedom of speech_ law and norms.
So, what happens when _freedom of speech_ norms are not only ignored but spurned.

It there a way to _univesally_ protect protests without _freedom of speech_?
Or have those who said "no" to _freedom of speech_ but were against the censoring he protest video ‚Äî have they "_foot-gunned_" themselves?

## Moderation versus Censorship

There is a discussion to had about _moderation_ versus _censorship_.

What is the difference between them‚ÄΩ
Is there a difference between them‚ÄΩ
Are they just different words for the same thing‚ÄΩ
And, as I will late argue, is this even the most important question to be asking‚ÄΩ

I will argue that in practice, in this context, that there is no semantic difference between the two.
In practice, _moderation_ and _censorship_ are semantically the same thing ‚Äî although perhaps differ in connotation ‚Äî just like the words "_and_" and "_but_".
I.e., you call _censorship_ that you like "_moderation_"; and you call _moderation_ that you don't like "_censorship_".

But I think focusing on that is missing an important point ‚Äî

Yes, it is true that, in practice, _moderation_ and _censorship_ have the same meaning, but ‚Äî

The problem is not that there is _moderation_ / _censorship_ per se ‚Äî

The problem is **_who_** is in control of it ‚Äî

You? Or someone else?

Do **_you_** get to decide what **_you_** do and do not get exposed to?
Or does someone else get to decide, against your will?

I think that is a more imporant distinction.

## Tools

Social-media has long provided a number of tools to put you in control
‚Äî
_muting_ people, keywords, hash-tags, and other things,
_blocking_ people,
_hiding_ your posts,
etc.

These tools put you in controls.

Platform moderators ... take the control away from you.

You might _not_ notice this when they censor things you don't want to see.
But, you likely will notice this when they censor something you feel should _not_ have been.

And, this was the case for many with the protest video.

Someone else (i.e., the Bluesky moderator) had the control.
Someone else effectively decide for you what you would or would not see.
And, if you were someone who did not agree with the censorship, then noticed all this.

## AI Moderation

Some see AI moderation as a panacea.

With AI moderation it also matter who is effectively in control of what **_you_** do and don't see ‚Äî **_you_** or someone else?

## Twitter Files

## Why Decentralization Matters

Why does decentralization matter‚ÄΩ

Decentralization is a means to an end
‚Äî
it produces a desired outcome.
It lets you escape something you feel is _bad_.

The world is _less-worse_ and even a _better_ place when people, in general, can escape what they feel are _bad_ situation_.
And, even better, if they can escape it without being ruined in the process.

The decentralization of social-media lets you escape _bad_ situation on social-media.

... examples ...

A single server on any decentralized social-media (DeSo) network, whether Bluesky, the Fediverse, or anything else ‚Äî is vulnerable to manipulation, censorship, spying, and control ‚Äî whether corporate, gov't, political, or any other type ‚Äî just like centralized social-media.

A single server on the Fediverse is also vulnerable to capture & takeover ‚Äî just like centralized social-media.

But (unlike centralized social-media) here is the good thing about decentralized social-media (DeSo) ‚Äî

A user on the Fediverse has a way of escaping ‚Äî to someone else's server or their own server ‚Äî if they feel things have gotten _bad_ on the server they are on.

And, they can take their followers and who they follow with them, etc, to the new account.

And, (eventually) they can take their content with them, too.

And, (if they are making their income on social-media) can take their livelihood with them, too, when they escape.

That is part of the value of decentralization.

You have a way of escaping ‚Äî and a way of taking everything important with you.

## Decentralization Has Helped

## Truth Social

But, what about politicians‚ÄΩ

It is perhaps interesting that one of the best examples of a politician using an independent social-media platform ‚Äî and one based on decentralized social-media (DeSo) technologies ‚Äî is: President Donland J. Trump on Truth Social.

President Trump has had a Twitter account since March 2009, and had been active on Twitter long before he became the 45th (and 47th) president of the United Statues of America (POTUS).

Starting in the year 2015, Mr. Trump's Twitter presence took on another significance ‚Äî as he _ran for_ and _became_ the 45th POTUS.
And, he and his Twitter account became the target of both _jeers_ and _cheers_ ‚Äî as is not uncommon for many individuals who take on a political-life or political-office.

[In January 2021, President Trump's Twitter account was suspended.](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension)
This was a significant event.
President Trump's Twitter account was a means by which he communicated in a more-or-less direct and unfiltered manner with hundreds-of-millions of people ‚Äî perhaps more.
To both his fans & supporters, as well as his critics & skeptics.
When President Trump's Twitter account was suspended, that medium, that ability, disappeared for him.

A little more than one year later, on February 2022, Mr. Trump appeared online again.
This time Mr. Trump appeared on a new social-media network named _Truth Social_.

Truth Social is a Twitter-like social-media network ‚Äî i.e., a micro-blogging social-media network.

Truth Social runs on a modified version of the Mastodon software.
And, although Truth Social is currently **not** part of the Fediverse ‚Äî this is the same Mastodon software that powers a large portion of the Fediverse.

Mastodon (like much of the software that powers the Fediverse) is free and open-source software (FOSS) ‚Äî and _anyone_ can use it.
Including Truth Social.

And, just like the many minorities, political dissidents, activists, and others that used Mastdon as a way of escaping a _bad_ situation ‚Äî so too did Mr. Trump.

## Mastodon Users

Mastodon is the same software that has been used to create a safe home for many minorities, for political dissidents, for activists, and more.
And, Mastodon is also the software that powers Truth Social.

Some argue that we should _cherry-pick_ who may and may not use software such as Mastodon.

Others (including some critics & skeptics of President Trump) will argue that ‚Äî the power to cherry-pick like that will create a much, much worse situation.
That the power to cherry-pick would also give people the power to discrimate against minorities, for political dissidents, for activists, and more.
And, that is worse.

> The cure is worse than the "disease".

Perhaps that phrase the general sentiment.

Others (including some critics & skeptics of President Trump) will argue that this is a good thing.
That the alternative is worse.

That with an alternative to this, that would ##### the _the cure would be worse than the "disease"_.

## Escape

For a society, the ability for an individual to _escape_ or not ‚Äî seems to determine whether the the society is more _egalitarian_ or more _despotic_ in nature.

The also seems to be true of _online societies_ ‚Äî such as social-media.

Or, metaphorically speaking, as was said in a famous Hermetic text:

> [ENGLISH]  
> That which is above is like to that which is below, and that which is below is like to that which is above.

Anthropologist and political scientist James C. Scott (who recently passed away on July 19, 2024) researched how ordinary people resist oppression.
He talked about how some groups have deliberately **escaped** to less accessible regions, such as mountainous or forested areas, to avoid control & oppression, and to maintain a degree of autonomy.

Another anthropologist, Christopher Boehm, ...

... gorillas .. .chimpanzees ... bonobos ... other primates ...

**Decentralization** is a _social-tool_ that enables **escape**.
The abililty to **escape** is important.

A single server on the decentralized social-media is vulnerable to manipulation, censorship, spying, and control ‚Äî whether corporate, gov't, political, or any other type ‚Äî just like centralized social-media.

A single server on the decentralized social-media is also vulnerable to capture & takeover ‚Äî just like centralized social-media.

But, (unlike centralized social-media) here is the good thing about decentralized social-media (DeSo) ‚Äî

A user on the decentralized social-media has a way of escaping ‚Äî to someone else's server or their own server ‚Äî if they feel things have gotten bad on the server they are on.

And, they can take their followers and who they follow with them, etc, to the new account.

And (eventually) they can take their content with them, too.

That is part of the value of decentralization.

You have a way of escaping ‚Äî and taking everything important with you.

A person who cannot find ... can always create there own social-network server ‚Äî their own home and castle on the ... where they can be _king_ or _queen_.

## Is Bluesky Decentralized

Is Bluesky actually decentralized?

Can you _foot-vote_ within Bluesky?
Can you _escape_ within Bluesky?

The answer is _not_ a simple "_yes_" or "_no_".

It depends.
It depends on whether you mean _right now_, or in a future that hasn't happened yet and we cannot be certain about.
It depends on whether you mean theoretically, or in practice.
It also depends on what you mean by "_Bluesky_".

I think the TL;DR answer for most normal (non-technical) people ‚Äî _no_ Bluesky is _not_ decentralized yet, **but** it looks like Bluesky might be at the start of decentralizing ‚Äî but it still has a long way to go before it gets there.
And, some things about Bluesky and the way peopole use it will probably have to change to make it happen.

For example ‚Äî

Users _could_ self-host their own Bluesky PDS (personal data server) rather than using a PDS (very generously) provided by the (friendly and nice) Bluesky team ‚Äî which would help decentralize Bluesky, but ‚Äî that isn't common yet.
(As an aside, the company I co-founderd, [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/), does provide Bluesky PDS hosting.)

Developers _could_ avoid using the centralized _Firehose-Relay_ that the (friendly and nice) Bluesky team (very generously) provides, and get new posts directly from the the PDSes (personal data servers) of the accounts a user follows (or from any other account of interest) ‚Äî which would help decentralize Bluesky, but ‚Äî that isn't common yet.
It seems like that vast majority of Bluesky (or ATmosphere) users use an application that gets its data from the Bluesky Firehose-Relay.

Developer _could_ deploy their own Relay for Bluesky, aggregating data from PDSes themselves, rather than relying on the centralized _Firehose-Relay_ ‚Äî which would help decentralize Bluesky, but ‚Äî that isn't common yet.
It seems like that vast majority of Bluesky (or ATmosphere) users use an application that gets its data from the Bluesky Firehose-Relay, rather than an alternative relay.

Developers _could_ create their own AppView, rather than just use the AppView that the (friendly and nice) Bluesky team (very generously) provides ‚Äî which would help decentralize Bluesky, but ‚Äî that isn't common yet.
It seems like that vast majority of Bluesky (or ATmosphere) users use an application that gets its data from the Bluesky team's AppView (rather than creating their own).

Users _could_ use a web-based front-end client other than the `bsky.app` provided by the (friendly and nice) Bluesky team ‚Äî which would help decentralize Bluesky, but ‚Äî that isn't common yet.
It seems like that vast majority of Bluesky (or ATmosphere) users use `bsky.app` when they are accessing Bluesky / ATmosphere from the Web.

Users _could_ use a mobile front-end client other than the official Bluesks apps provided by the (friendly and nice) Bluesky team ‚Äî which would help decentralize Bluesky, but ‚Äî that isn't common yet.
It seems like that vast majority of Bluesky (or ATmosphere) users use the official Bluesks apps when they are accessing Bluesky / ATmosphere from a mobile phone.

Inferring tone from text isn't always easy.
So, I want to be clear that ‚Äî
I think the Bluesky team seem like good people.
I think the Bluesky team are trying to do the right thing.
And, I don't have anything bad to say about any of them.

But I wanted to answer the question ("_is Bluesky actually decentralized?_") accurately.
So, not yet, but I am hopeful for the future.

## DeSo

In fact, I am hopeful for the future for all of decentralized social-media (DeSo) ‚Äî Bluesky, the Fediverse, Nostr, Farcaster, etc.

I think the world is a little less-worse with decentralized social-media in it.
And, hopefully, a little better.
